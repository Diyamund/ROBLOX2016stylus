# ROBLOX 2016 Userstyles/Stylus
Stylish/stylus browser addon.
![Preview of style](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/images/2016_stuff/preview.jpg?raw=true "Preview")
<br>
Trying to keep the script up to date by making sure images and other stuff still work because on the original css file had files that depended on roblox's server itself and recently roblox has started to move or delete those files.<br>
I'm also changing some things like adding small fixes.

### Credit
All credit to Ologist for originally making this incredible user-style theme!
This is just me adding onto it and fixing some little things.

#### Compatability  
I know this 100% works well on Chromium based browsers such as [Brave](https://brave.com/) which is my main browser but I haven't tested it on FireFox since late 2020. 
Create an issue if you, well, find an issue with compatability and I'll be sure to try and fix it.
