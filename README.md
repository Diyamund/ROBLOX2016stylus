# ROBLOX 2016 Userstyles/Stylus
Stylish/stylus browser addon.
![Preview of style](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/images/2016_stuff/preview.jpg?raw=true "Preview")
<br>
Trying to keep the script up to date by making sure images and other stuff still work because on the original css file had files that depended on roblox's server itself and recently roblox has started to move or delete those files.<br>
I'm also changing some things like adding small fixes.

## Userscript

It'll be under these three releases<br>

### Credit
All credit to Ologist for originally making this incredible user-style theme!
This is just me adding onto it and fixing some little things.

### Compatability
This should work on 
- [Brave](https://brave.com/)
- [Firefox](https://firefox.com/) (some things don't render properly; just reload that usually fixes it). 
As always if something doesnt work, create an [issue](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/issues).
- Microsoft Edge
- I'm assuming most Chromium-based browsers
