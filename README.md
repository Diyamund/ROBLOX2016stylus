# ROBLOX 2016 Userstyles/Stylus
Stylish/stylus browser addon.
![Preview of style](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/images/2016_stuff/preview.jpg?raw=true "Preview")
<br>
Trying to keep the script up to date by making sure images and other stuff still works because the original CSS file had files that depended on Roblox's server itself, and recently Roblox has started to move or delete those files.<br>
I'm also changing some things, like adding small fixes. 
<br>
## Open source information
If you know how to fix anything that hasn't been fixed already or see anything that could be improved, I encourage you to create a fork or make a pull request and fix it! I don't really know much CSS myself, so any contribution, even fixing the smallest little thing, is greatly appreciated!

## Find this at user styles
It'll be under these three releases<br>
https://userstyles.org/styles/189625/, https://userstyles.org/styles/189624, and https://userstyles.org/styles/195713/
## Beta/unreleased
Prerelease, beta, alpha, unreleased, etc. I don't know what to call it. 
To find unreleased changes go to [stylustheme.css](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/stylustheme.css).
For more information (changes and everything), head over to [unreleasedChanges.md](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/unreleasedChanges.md).

### Credit
All credit to Ologist for originally making this incredible user-style theme!
This is just me adding to it and fixing some little things.

### Compatability
This should work on 
- [Brave](https://brave.com/)
- [Firefox](https://firefox.com/) (sometimes things don't render properly; reloading usually fixes it). 
As always, if something doesn't work, create an [issue](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/issues).
- Microsoft Edge
- I'm assuming most Chromium-based browsers
Display Compatability
Your display/monitor has to be AT LEAST 544 pixels wide for this style to work properly. 
I'd recommend at least a 1366 x 768 monitor or, even better, a 1920 x 1080 monitor.
