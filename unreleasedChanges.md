# Unreleased | 1.1.7 <br>
This version is not yet 100% released and could have bugs. 
Get the beta [here](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/stylustheme.css).
## Games page changes
- When hovering over a game tile, the like button turns green. 
- 11px margin at the games page changed to a 1px margin because it conflicted with the home page. 
- Changed some text on the avatar page. 
- Got the 11px left margin to work without messing up the home page. 
## Game search results
- Featured game fixes to be uniform with the rest of the game tiles. Check out before and after images [here.](https://imgur.com/a/4BaqYto)
## Code changes
- Cleaned up some code and removed some random things. 
## Notifications
- Fix button color of friend requests. 
## General site changes
- Font face fixes to chat; still don't know why the top header font breaks when on the develop page. 
- Chat rounded corners fixed. On the Develop Page, rounded corners now show; when on other pages, rounded corners no longer have a white background.
- Changed link text for orange notif header. 
- Removed the "Get More" button from the Avatar Editor page. 
- Search dropdown changed back to the old dropdown. 
- Fixed left carousel arrow positioning
- Join button when first installing roblox background fix
### Known bugs
- When on the develop page, for some unknown reason, random things start to glitch out, like the gray highlights over the Games, Catalog, etc., clipping outside of the header when hovering. Some other elements break, such as the box-radius rule on the chat bar. 
- Different font when searching for friends.
