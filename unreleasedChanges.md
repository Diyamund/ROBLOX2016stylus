# BETA | 1.1.6
## Major Changes
- Fixed arrow background (SVG) positioning on the game page and profile creation carousels. Arrows now display the arow instead of another icon. 
## Minor Changes 
- Changed the gray highlight from 85% to 90% for the [top header](https://i.ibb.co/r5tKqKX/image.png) (games, catalog, etc.) 
- Made the games page arrows opaque but retained the same color. 
- Moved stuff around to save some space. The file is still riding that 100kb limit. 
- Game icon border radius changed to 3px.  
- Added an 11-pixel gap from the arrow to the first game tile. 
- Recommended games fix (for my browser).
- Fixed the width for the "[Back to private servers](https://imgur.com/a/JBuWZHp)" button.
- Fixed game tile box shadows.
- Small changes to the Catalog search bar.
- Polished up the game scroller buttons.
## Could be removed changes
Changes could be removed because I don't yet know its effects on the rest of the website.
- Buttons "Add people" and "Generate" text changed to black. 
- Removed !important tag next to the button color so if you created a private server, the text wouldn't be [white](https://i.ibb.co/PN8f5D7/image.png). 
- Problem could be specific to my browser. Fixed large gaps in between game cards on the [Home > Personal Recommendation page](https://www.roblox.com/discover#/sortName/v2/Recommended%20For%20You). [Before](https://i.ibb.co/NVQQkd6/image.png) [After](https://ibb.co/sVd9v8f).
- Some things were changed on the buy premium page. 
- Bottom "view featured items" button width changed to be wider.
- "Fixed" the margins between the items in the catalog.

### Compatability
This should work on 
- [Brave](https://brave.com/)
- [Firefox](https://firefox.com/) (some things don't render properly; reloading usually fixes it). 
As always, if something doesn't work, create an [issue](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/issues).
- Microsoft Edge
- I'm assuming most Chromium-based browsers
