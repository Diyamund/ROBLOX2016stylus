## Code changes
- Cleaned up some code and removed some random things. 
## Notifications
- Fix button color of friend requests. 
## Site changes
- Font face fixes to the chat. Still don't know why the top header font breaks when on the develop page. 

### Known bugs
- When on the develop page for some unknown reason random things start to glitch out like the gray highlights over the Games, Catalog, etc clipping outside of the header when hovering. Some other things also break such as the box-radius rule on the chat bar. 
- Different font when searching for friends.
