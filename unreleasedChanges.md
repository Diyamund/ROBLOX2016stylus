# Beta-preview | 1.1.9
This version is not yet 100% released and could have bugs. 
Get the beta [here](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/stylustheme.css).
"Stable" versions can be found at [Github/releases](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/releases).
## Major changes
- Fixed the top header gray highlight problem. Refer to Known Bugs.
## Small changes
- Fixed the search bar. (Large gap in between "Search" and search query.)
- Changed the border-radius of some buttons. 
## Games list changes
- Fixed shadows cutting of when viewing a large list of games (after searching or clicking "See all") 
- Changed the position of the featured game when searching. Pretty much adding onto the above fix.  
- Softened game tile shadows. 
## Banned page changes
- Got banned and fixed the buttons there. Made them look like IE 11. [Reference image](https://i.ibb.co/DGfy6xM/3917e9527abcdee0387d51e0c6f773c20a9350d0.jpg) If anyone out there wants to know how to get it just save the page (Ctrl + S) then select the id from there. In my case, it was button#reactivate-button.
## 404-page fixes
- Fixed the button colors and size.
## Catalog changes
- Changed the limited labels back to their old 2016 variants. 
## Code changes
- Adding some sitewide rules. This should, in the future, lower the amount of CSS I have to put in; effectively lowering the size of the file in the future. 
### Known bugs
- FIXED: When on the develop page, for some unknown reason, random things start to glitch out, like the gray highlights over the Games, Catalog, etc., clipping outside of the header when hovering. Some other elements break, such as the box-radius rule on the chat bar. 
- FIXED: Different font when searching for friends.
