- [BETTER ROBLOX] Big thanks to [Diyamund](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/issues/7) for making BTRoblox icons to be consistent with 2016.

[Before](https://i.ibb.co/PwgjTcZ/image.png), [After](https://i.ibb.co/8zrZ9LH/image.png) | [Reference Image](https://imgr.search.brave.com/mYrJP_-JRZk6ViEc2S6K9afu23NDlY2rjB80ViEZwRw/fit/1200/649/ce/1/aHR0cHM6Ly92aWdu/ZXR0ZS53aWtpYS5u/b2Nvb2tpZS5uZXQv/cm9ibG94L2ltYWdl/cy9mL2ZlL0hvbWVz/Y3JlZW4ucG5nL3Jl/dmlzaW9uL2xhdGVz/dD9jYj0yMDE3MDIw/NTIyNTAwMw).
- [SEE ALL BUTTON] Changed minimum width to be more faithful to 2016.
- [SEE ALL BUTTON] Changed shadow to be more faithful to 2016. 
- [GAMES PAGE/CAROUSEL ARROW CHANGES] Fixed up arrows to be more faithful to 2016. 
- [HOME PAGE] Got rid of the other random game & avatar containers. 90% chance it'll break but I should be studying rn.  
- [SOME TROLLING] Don't worry, it won't be in the final release. It's under the comment ``/* WE DO A LITTLE TROLLING */``
- [BUTTONS] Made the "I agree" button shown when signing a roblox contract uniform with normal buttons.  
## Known bugs
- Under profile pages, the about section and the report section don't correctly splice together. I'll try working on a fix for that when I have the time, but today (10/11/2021) is my last day off, and I have a project due on the 13th, plus I do be failing math, 49% avg & a 51% class avg. Whoever thought Grade 11 Functions was a good idea is burning in hell rn. My teacher boosted everyone's averages cuz I'm pretty sure it'd look bad when the principal does a staff review or something. Idk man, someone help me; cheating isn't cutting it anymore :(.
