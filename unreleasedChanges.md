# Unreleased | 1.1.8 <br>
This version is not yet 100% released and could have bugs. 
Get the beta [here](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/stylustheme.css).
## Major changes
- Font change. Idk could have been my pc but the fonts messed up, so I took [Ologist’s code](https://userstyles.org/styles/178105/roblox-in-2016) for the custom font. Its around line 37 so you can get rid of it. 
## Small changes
- When the window is too small, I hid the scroll bar on the friend’s list. 

### Known bugs
- When on the develop page, for some unknown reason, random things start to glitch out, like the gray highlights over the Games, Catalog, etc., clipping outside of the header when hovering. Some other elements break, such as the box-radius rule on the chat bar. 
- Different font when searching for friends.
